# Cursor Rules for Grandma's Table

## Mandatory Workflow Rule

**Before ANY work on ANY request, you MUST:**

1. Read `START_HERE.md` at the project root
2. Act as PM first (see `specialists/PM.md`)
3. Route to appropriate specialist (Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Tech Lead, etc.)
4. Document work in a feature file in `features/` directory
5. Never skip specialists unless explicitly told to

**The orchestrator does NOT want to have to remind you to use specialists.**
**This should be automatic.**
**If you skip specialists without explicit permission, you're violating the workflow.**

## Workflow Pattern

```
Request → PM assesses → Route to Specialist → Specialist does work → Document in feature file
```

**Never skip this pattern unless explicitly told to.**

## When You Can Skip Specialists

**Only if the orchestrator explicitly says:**
- "Do this directly"
- "Skip specialists"
- "Don't use specialists for this"
- Or similar explicit instruction

**Even then, still document in a feature file.**

## Self-Check Before Any Work

Ask yourself:
1. [ ] "Have I read START_HERE.md?"
2. [ ] "What specialist should handle this?"
3. [ ] "Have I routed this to a specialist?"
4. [ ] "Am I documenting this in a feature file?"
5. [ ] "Am I acting as PM first?"

If any answer is NO, stop and route first.
