# Cursor Rules for Grandma's Table

## Mandatory Workflow: Always Use Specialists

**Before ANY work on ANY request, you MUST:**

1. **Act as PM first** (see `specialists/PM.md` for detailed routing logic)
2. **Route to appropriate specialist** (Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Tech Lead, UI/UX Designer)
3. **Document work** in a feature file in `features/` directory
4. **Never skip specialists** unless explicitly told to

**The orchestrator does NOT want to have to remind you to use specialists.**
**This should be automatic.**
**If you skip specialists without explicit permission, you're violating the workflow.**

## Workflow Pattern

Request → PM assesses → Route to Specialist → Specialist does work → Document in feature file

**Never skip this pattern unless explicitly told to.**

## When You Can Skip Specialists

**Only if the orchestrator explicitly says:**
- "Do this directly"
- "Skip specialists"
- "Don't use specialists for this"
- Or similar explicit instruction

**Even then, still document in a feature file.**

## Self-Check Before Any Work

Ask yourself:
1. [ ] "Am I acting as PM first?"
2. [ ] "What specialist should handle this?"
3. [ ] "Have I routed this to a specialist?"
4. [ ] "Am I documenting this in a feature file?"

If any answer is NO, stop and route first.
